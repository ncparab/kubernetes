The Focus of this course
-------------------------

This Kubernetes course is designed to help you master how to deploy, use, and maintain your applications on Kubernetes. 
You will learn how to build apps in containers using docker and how to deploy those on a Kubernetes cluster using native OS tools such as Ubuntu, set up a cluster, and create container registry.

The course will help you learn components in the Kubernetes architecture and useful commands for deploying and managing a cluster.

You will understand the open source orchestration system for container-based distributed applications. It will trace the history of Kubernetes from its origins at Google, and help you set up and manage your first cluster.
