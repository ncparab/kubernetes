Introduction
-------------

Kubernetes is a powerful open-source system, initially developed by Google, for managing containerized applications in a clustered environment. It aims to provide better ways of managing related, distributed components and services across varied infrastructure.

Kubernetes, at its basic level, is a system for running and coordinating containerized applications across a cluster of machines. It is a platform designed to completely manage the life cycle of containerized applications and services using methods that provide predictability, scalability, and high availability.
